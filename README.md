The issue tab is not your free support platform.  
Sharing coding does not mean that I'm interested in  
(1) helping you learning bash, python, what ever,  
(2) help you to use basic tools like pip,  
(3) help you to debug issues caused by your customizations/configuations,  
(4) citing the documentation as you're to lazy to read it,  
(5) fixing issues which does not bother or affect me,  
(6) and so on.  
A disabled issue tab does not mean 'just create an issue in some of my other projects'.
